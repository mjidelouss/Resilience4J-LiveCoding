# Resilience4J-LiveCoding

Resilience4j is a Java library designed to help developers implement resilience patterns in their applications. Resilience patterns are mechanisms that enhance a system's ability to handle and recover from failures gracefully. Resilience4j provides a set of lightweight, modular, and easy-to-use components for building resilient applications, particularly in distributed systems and microservices architectures.

# Key features of Resilience4j:

- Circuit Breaker Pattern: Resilience4j allows developers to implement the circuit breaker pattern, which helps prevent system overload and cascading failures by temporarily stopping the execution of requests to a failing component.

- Retry Mechanism: The library provides a flexible and customizable retry mechanism, enabling developers to specify how many times an operation should be retried and with what delays between retries.

- Rate Limiting: Resilience4j supports rate limiting, allowing developers to control the rate at which certain operations are executed to prevent resource exhaustion or abuse.

- Bulkhead Pattern: Bulkheading is a pattern to isolate components or services from each other to prevent the failure of one component from affecting others. Resilience4j supports bulkheading strategies.

- Timeouts: Developers can set timeouts for operations to prevent them from taking too long and potentially causing performance issues or blocking the system.

- Monitoring and Metrics: Resilience4j provides metrics and monitoring capabilities to track the behavior and performance of resilience strategies, helping developers understand how their systems are handling failures.

- Time Limiter: The Time Limiter in Resilience4j helps in setting time constraints for the execution of certain operations.
It allows developers to define a maximum time duration for an operation to complete. If the operation exceeds this specified time, it can be interrupted or canceled to prevent potential performance issues or timeouts.
Cache:

- Cache: caching mechanism can be used to cache the results of function calls or responses from external services.
Caching helps in improving performance by storing and reusing previously computed or retrieved data, reducing the need to repeatedly perform the same operation.
Developers can configure various aspects of the cache, such as expiration policies, eviction strategies, and key mappings.
